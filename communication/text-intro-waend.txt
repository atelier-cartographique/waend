Wænd is a web platform for subjective and collaborative spatial publication.

With Wænd you can create your maps from scratch, publish territorial representations from your very personal point of view, and collaborate on existing maps.  

The platform is under development, and an alpha version is accessible at http://alpha.waend.com.

Since Waend is still under construction, some parts can be a bit rough, unclear, or even buggy. But it works ! (See http://waend.com for some maps exemples)


This guide will help you to walk the very first steps in it, and we hope it will help you to feel comfortable with this unusual web application.


There are two surprising aspects you will discover : 

- While most of the actions can be done by clicking on the menu buttons, the main tool to work on Wænd is a command line. You will have to type the commands. They are listed in the Help section. Try it, it’s easy and you won’t break anything. 

- There is no map background : you will start on a blank page. It’s not a bug, but a choice we’ve made to wide-up the spectrum of what cartography could be. No map background means no influence from us on how a territory should be represented. You can do whatever you want. 


Those aspects are quite radical choices and it can be a bit confusing at first, but it keeps the platform very open and flexible, with the least influence possible on your cartographic publications.

We like to say that Wænd is not meant to create a map of the world, but a world of maps. 

We hope to see you there !

##Introduction to `KEY | VALUE` system in Wænd


You can use Wænd without using the `key | value` system.  
However, if you would like to make a deeper use of your datas or publish them with some custom styles, you might be interrested on that part.

The principle is that you can give specific characteristics to each group, layer or feature you've created. 

The first and basic use of `key | value`, is to set a name to what you create. it will be like : `name | myName`.

Some of the most common characteristics are pre-displayed in Wænd, such as `name` `description` etc..

You can have a more advanced use of that, by giving more characteristics to your features. From there, you can start to style them according to their characteristics.



As this `key | value` concept can look a bit abstract at first, let's have an exemples of an mid-advanced use : 

	Pol started a map with infos on 3 trees in a park
	Each tree has some specific charateristics that he wants to use, such as the type of tree, its age and height.
	So for each tree, Pol used the key | value system as such :
	
	        key | value
	
	       name | tree 1
	     specie | pin
	        age | 23 
	     height | 12
	
	       name | tree 2
	     specie | pin
	        age | 15 
	     height | 9
	
	       name | tree 3
	     specie | oak
	        age | 60 
	     height | 17
	     
	     
	     Now Pol can use the keys "age", "height" or "specie" to style his trees on his map. 
	     He could use like : 
	     
	     * The older the tree is, the wider it will be displayed.
	     * The taller the tree is, the darker it will be displayed
	     * Change the color accroding to the specie.


`key | value` is used everywhere in Wænd, and this section will be updated regularly. 




##Add some style to your datas

There are three ways to set the visual aspect of your elements.  

- At a layer level  
- At a feature level  
- By coding your own layer renderer

###LAYER STYLE with CLI

By setting the layer style, you set the overall style for that layer. 

default style : 

	KEY         | DEFAULT VALUE 
	
	zoomable	| true				   
	name		| id				   
	radius		| 20			      
	style		| {"fill-color":"white",
				   "stroke-color":"blue",
				   "stroke-width":2
				   }



Availables styles variables : 

 =="fill-color":"value"==
 
	exemples : 
	"fill-color":"orange"  
	"fill-color":"#FFA500"   
	"fill-color":"rgb(255,165,0)"  
	"fill-color":"rgba(255,165,0,1)"
	
 =="stroke-color":"value"==  
 
 	exemples : 
	"stroke-color":"orange"  
	"stroke-color":"#FFA500"   
	"stroke-color":"rgb(255,165,0)"
	"stroke-color":"rgba(255,165,0,1)"

	
 =="stroke-width":number==

	exemple : 
	"stroke-width":2
	
=="opacity":number==

	exemple : 
	"opacity":0.8
	
=="font":"value"==

The current text style being used when drawing text. This string uses the same syntax as the CSS font property. The default font is 10px sans-serif.

	exemple : 
	"font":"italic small-caps 16px serif"



Advanced :

* lineCap = type
* lineJoin = type
* miterLimit = value
* getLineDash()
* lineDashOffset = value


###FEATURE STYLES

By setting a feature style, you can override the layer style for that specific feature.

####POINT

	point_type | value
	
values : 

* circle
* symbol
* pictogram
* text
* image
* sound

USES OF KEYS | VALUES BY POINT / FEATURE TYPE


#####ALL : 
	zoomable | boolean 
	default = true

#####CIRCLE : 

Default point in Wænd. 
If no values are defined, the default circle is rendered. 

	radius | number
	style | json
	fillStyle / strokeStyle / setLineDash /lineWidth


#####SYMBOL : 


#####PICTOGRAM : 

if type | pictogram is selected, Wænd will render the point as a pre-defined pictogram. This rendered item displays  two initials and a label. 
If no initials or label are defined, it will use the first word of the name value.

	name | string
	label | string
	init | string
	style : fillStyle / strokeStyle / setLineDash (?)
	font ?


#####TEXT : 

if type | text is selected, you can display text on your map. 
It will render the text from the « text » key.
If no width is defined, the text will be on one line.
If a width is defined, the text will adapt to that width. 

	style : font (CSS properties) / fillText / strokeText / textAlign 
	width | value



#####IMAGE :
